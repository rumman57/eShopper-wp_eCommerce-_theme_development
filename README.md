This is my first Wordpress eCommerce  theme development project from HTML template named eShopper.

Template Download Link: [eShopper Template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t0u7alejztn9mya/eshopper-best-free-ecommerce-html-template.zip?dl=0)

## How To Run Source Code

First you have to download whole project source code.Then create a Database. Suppose your database name is 'wptest'. 

Open Source Code.Go to Database Folder , open eshopper.sql from any texteditor. Next open readme.txt and copy the text. Then 'replace all' this  text from eshopper.sql to 'path where you keep your source code'. 

Example:  http://localhost/wptestsite ===> replace all ===> http://rh-rumman/wordpress/eshopper

Now go to phpmyadmin & select your database. Import this sql file.

Put your code to your exact location.

Open "wp-config.php". Change DB_NAME,DB_USER & DB_PASSWORD as you set.

**Admin Panel : Username => 'rumman' & Password => 'rumman57'**

Go To Settings->Permalinks. In common settings select 'Post Name' & Save Changes.

#### That's All.Thanks.
